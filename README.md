* **Lesson 06**: Revision


<br />


* **Lesson 07**: Accessing Web Services

    Links:
    * [YDKJS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS):
              section *Async & Performance*.

    Exercises: look at [http://www.programmableweb.com/](http://www.programmableweb.com/).
               Select one API of your choice.
               Write a small React page in which you do a GET on an endpoint of such API
               and display its results.  

<br />

* **Lesson 08**: REST APIs

    Links:
    * [Express](http://expressjs.com/)
    * [SuperTest](https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest)
              
    Exercises: write a small REST API using NodeJS/Express on a topic of your choice,
               with endpoints for at least: GET, POST, PUT and DELETE.
               Create a small React app that consumes such API. 


* **Lesson 09**: WebSockets

    Links:
    * [Socket.io](https://socket.io/)

    Exercises: on an app of your choice that you are building (e.g., any of the previous
    exercises), add the following functionality: display in the frontend the total number
    of users that are online. You will need to connect a WebSocket, intercept the events
    for "connect" and "disconnect" of each user, and broadcast the number of users at
    each new connect/disconnect.

## Useful NPM Commands

* **npm init -y**

  To create a new project, in particular the *package.json* file.

* **npm install**

  To download and install under *node_modules* all the needed libraries
  specified in the *package.json* file.
  Note: instead of installing libraries via NPM commandline, you
  can modify the *package.json* file manually.

* **npm run X**

  Execute the script called `X`  in the `scripts` section of
  the the *package.json* file.

* **npm install webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server --save-dev**

  To install WebPack.

* **npm install jest babel-jest babel-cli babel-core babel-preset-es2015 --save-dev**

  To install *Jest* with *Babel* support.
  Needed when writing frontend code, but then tests are run on
  *NodeJS*. So, need to make sure to use *Babel* to transform the
  module import statements.

* **npm install react react-dom react-router-dom**

  To install *React* libraries.

* **npm install babel-core babel-loader  babel-preset-react  --save-dev**

  To install *Babel* to handle the JSX files used by *React*.
  
* **npm install express cors**
  
  To install Express and CORS, needed to build REST APIs on NodeJS.

* **npm install socket.io socket.io-client**

  To install support for WebSockets, both for servers and clients.
